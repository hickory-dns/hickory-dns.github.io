# Introduction

Welcome to the Hickory DNS User Manual. This book will be updated as issues and questions arise.

In some cases the best source of information about how to use the project is in the source repository, [Hickory DNS](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns).

Contributions to this book will always be welcome, [Hickory Docs](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns.github.io/tree/main/book).

Thank you to the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) community for making this project possible.
